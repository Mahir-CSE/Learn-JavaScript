# 50 JavaScript Practice Problems [Lecture: 01-03]

## EASY LEVEL (Problems 1-20)

### Variables & Data Types
1. Create variables using `let`, `const`, and `var` to store your name, age, and favorite color. Display them using `console.log()`.

2. Write a program that prompts the user for their name and displays "Hello [name]!" using `alert()`.

3. Create variables to store different data types (string, number, boolean, undefined, null) and use `typeof` to check their types.

4. Declare a constant for PI (3.14159) and calculate the area of a circle with radius 5.

### Basic Operations
5. Create a simple calculator that adds two numbers entered by the user via `prompt()`.

6. Write a program that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C Ã— 9/5) + 32.

7. Calculate the remainder when 17 is divided by 5 using the modulo operator.

8. Use unary operators to convert a string "25" to a number and increment it by 1.

### Conditional Statements
9. Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

10. Create a program that determines if a person can vote (age >= 18).

11. Write a program using switch statement to display the day of the week based on a number (1-7).

12. Check if a year entered by the user is a leap year or not.

### Basic Loops
13. Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.

14. Use a `while` loop to print even numbers from 2 to 20.

15. Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using any loop.

16. Print your name 5 times using a `do-while` loop.

### Basic Strings
17. Create a string with your full name and display its length.

18. Convert a string "JAVASCRIPT" to lowercase and "javascript" to uppercase.

19. Use template literals to create a sentence: "My name is [name] and I am [age] years old."

20. Extract the first 5 characters from the string "Programming".

## **MEDIUM LEVEL (Problems 21-35)**

### Advanced Operations
21. Create a program that swaps two variables without using a third variable.

22. Write a program that finds the largest of three numbers using nested ternary operators.

23. Use logical operators to check if a number is between 10 and 50 (inclusive).

24. Create a bitwise operation program that checks if a number is even or odd using the AND operator.

### Complex Conditionals
25. Write a program that determines grades based on marks:
    - A: 90-100
    - B: 80-89
    - C: 70-79
    - D: 60-69
    - F: Below 60

26. Create a simple login system that checks username and password using logical operators.

27. Write a program that determines the season based on month number (1-12).

28. Create a program that calculates discount based on purchase amount:
    - 20% for amount > 1000
    - 10% for amount > 500
    - 5% for amount > 200
    - No discount otherwise

### Advanced Loops
29. Print multiplication table of any number using nested loops.

30. Use `for-in` loop to iterate through an object's properties: `{name: "John", age: 25, city: "NYC"}`.

31. Use `for-of` loop to iterate through an array: `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`.

32. Create a pattern printing program:
    ```
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
    ```

### String Manipulation
33. Write a program that counts the number of vowels in a given string.

34. Create a function that reverses a string without using built-in reverse method.

35. Check if a given string is a palindrome (reads same forwards and backwards).

## **HARD LEVEL (Problems 36-50)**

### Complex Algorithms
36. Write a program to find all prime numbers between 1 and 100.

37. Create a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.

38. Write a program that finds the factorial of a number using both loops and recursion concept.

39. Create a program that checks if a number is an Armstrong number (sum of cubes of digits equals the number).

### Advanced String Problems
40. Write a program that counts the frequency of each character in a string.

41. Create a program that finds the longest word in a sentence.

42. Write a program that removes duplicate characters from a string.

43. Create a Caesar cipher program that shifts each letter by n positions.

### Complex Logic Problems
44. Write a program that converts a decimal number to binary.

45. Create a program that finds the second largest number in an array without sorting.

46. Write a program that generates a random password with specified length containing letters, numbers, and symbols.

47. Create a number guessing game where the computer generates a random number and the user has to guess it.

### Integration Problems
48. Create a comprehensive student management system that:
    - Stores student data (name, age, marks)
    - Calculates grades
    - Determines pass/fail status
    - Uses all types of loops and conditionals

49. Build a simple text analyzer that:
    - Counts words, characters, sentences
    - Finds most frequent word
    - Checks for specific patterns
    - Uses multiple string methods

50. Create a mini banking system that:
    - Handles deposits and withdrawals

## **Tips for Practice:**
- Start with easy problems and gradually move to harder ones
- Try to solve each problem using different approaches
- Use `console.log()` frequently to debug your code
- Practice writing clean, readable code with proper variable names
- Don't hesitate to revisit easier problems to strengthen fundamentals
