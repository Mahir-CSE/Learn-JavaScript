# Operators in JavaScript:

Example: a + b = c 
    (a, b) = operands,
    (+, =) = Operators

    1. Arithmatic Operators: 
        a. Basic Calculations: +, , *, /
        b. Modulus: % (Calculate the remainder)
        c. Exponential operators: a ** b 
        d. Unary Operators:
            i. increment: ++;   a++(Post), ++a(Pre)
            ii. Decrement: --

            Example of Pre and Post: a = 5, b = 7
                #. a++ = 5
                #. ++a = 6
                #. b-- = 7
                #. --b = 6

    2. Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=
    3. Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >=, <=, ===, !==
        -> In JavaScript, if a = 5, and b= "5" and if we check, (a == b); it will give us true.
        -> Because, at first the string will convert into number and then the comparison will occur.
        -> If we want to check the datatype as well, we need to use === or !==

    4. Logical Operators:
        a. Logical AND (&&): When all events are true, we get the final result true
        b. Logical OR (||): When at least one event is true, we get the final result true
        c. Logical NOT (!): We get the opposite
