There are 2 types of datatypes in JavaScript; typeOf ('variableName') -> will provide the datatype of the variable
    1. Primitive: 
        a. These are immutable and stored by value
        b. Primitive datatypes:
            1. Numbers, 
            2. String, 
            3. Boolean, 
            4. Undefined, 
            5. Null, (Note: typeof null returns "object" â€” this is a known JavaScript bug)
            6. BigInt, 
            7. Symbol
    2. Non-Primitive (These are mutable and stored by reference): Objects, Arrays, Functions etc.
        a. Objects: Collection of values 
        b. syntax: objectName ={
            key : value
        }
        c. Example:
            student = {
                name : "Mahir",
                age: 25,
                cgpa: 3.70,
                isGraduated: true,
                address: null
            }
        d. key can be accessed in 2 ways:
            i. objectName.key  //dot notation
            ii. objectName["key"] //bracket notation
        e. two update an object we need to update every key to update the object.
        f. individual keu of a const object can be updated

#. Mutable VS Immutable:
    1. mutability refers to whether a value can be changed after it's created, while immutability means the value cannot be changed.
    2. Mutable : New memory allocation on change; Immutable: same memory location just value change
